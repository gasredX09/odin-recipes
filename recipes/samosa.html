        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>3/4 pound ground lamb</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>3/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix flour, salt and butter until the mixture 
            resembles fine bread crumbs. Pour in water, using more (up to approximately 1/4 cup) 
            if necessary to make a smooth dough.</li> 
            
            <li>Pat into a ball. Place on a lightly floured 
            surface and knead 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic. 
            Return to the bowl, cover and set aside.</li>
    
            <li>Heat oil in a large, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    
            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in onion, garlic, 
            green chile peppers and ginger. Cook 5 minutes, or until onions are golden brown.</li>

            <li>Stir in turmeric, chili powder, ground lamb and salt. Cook until the lamb meat is 
            evenly brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in garam masala and lemon juice. 
            Continue cooking 5 minutes, then remove from heat.</li>

            <li>Divide dough into 15 equal portions. Roll portions into balls, then flatten into 
            4 inch circles. Cut each circle in half.</li> 
            
            <li>Dampen edges and form semicircles into cones. 
            Fill cones with equal portions of the lamb meat mixture. Dampen top and bottom edges of cones, 
            and pinch to seal.</li>

            <li>Carefully lower cones into preheated oil a few at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
