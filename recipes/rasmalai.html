        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Ras Malai is cheese dumplings in cream sauce. 
            This is a popular Indian dessert and takes a long time to 
            prepare the traditional way. I came up with some shortcuts 
            and ended up with this recipe which tastes exactly the same as traditional Ras Malai.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>3 cups half and half</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon rose water (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped blanched almond<s</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Blend the ricotta cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together 
            in a bowl with a hand mixer; divide the mixture between 
            12 muffin cups.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 
            into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. </li>

            <li>Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool 
            completely on a wire rack. Arrange the cheese balls onto a 
            dessert platter.</li>

            <li>While the cheese bakes, pour the half and half into a 
            saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat; simmer 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir 1 cup sugar, the cardamom, rose water, and saffron into the half 
            and half and simmer another 2 minutes. </li>

            <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Drizzle the cooled mixture over 
            the cheese balls. Sprinkle the almonds and pistachios over the 
            cheese balls to serve.</li>
        </ol>
